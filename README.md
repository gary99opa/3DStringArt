3D String Art v1.0 &amp; Graphics Demo v9938/58 (1988/1990) by Oasis Pensive Abacutors / GARYOPA

/ SOURCE CODE RELEASE by Oasis Pensive Abacutors and Gary Bowser (aka) GARYOPA
/ FROM THE O.P.A. 1988/1990 ARCHIVES
/ 36 YEARS SITTING IN A TEXAS INSTRUMENTS 99/4A TIME CAPSULE

The other day on the TI99 Zoom Call, a developer inquired about the graphics running in the background on my system, so as promised I have now publicly released the source code from what I originally called 3D STRING ART, which was written back in 1988 for the Myarc Geneve 9640 and then updated in 1990 for my TI-Image-Maker and Dijit AVPC cards, it will NOT run on consoles with the F18A upgrade, but it will run perfectly on any v9938 / v9958 system and it should on MAME setup as well, but I have not tested it.

In this GITHUB repo, only the source files are included, if you wish to find already complied versions for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4a Home Computer to run on your real hardware, please visit our original release post in the TI99 section of AtariAge forums at this URL:

Also please NOTE the "copyright" notices in the various files, mainly the VDP-LIB file, I will be adding some documentation on how the various BLWP's work and their usage, but already in the comments in the 9900 source code is a simple layout of the calling registers used and data to be passed.

You are all welcome to enjoy the code, change it and modify it for your own usage, but "proper credit" for using the library routines in VDP-LIB or the original "string art" plotting stuff in ART-S would be highly appreciated, and slowly I will be releasing more source code from the O.P.A. library, and also trying to figure out how to get "github" to work for me, for larger software project releases in the near future.

Enjoy! ðŸ¥³
